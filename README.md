    To the bootcamp for providing the readme for the assignment,

    Classmates for forming study groups to problem solve and figure it out -- thanks to Nick D, Jay B, Clinton R and Blake B for helping with debugging, discussing and all around -definitelyneverventing- support!

    Tutors and TAs (OMG, thank you so much, Chandler! Forever grateful!) for being patient and helping us out,

    Google (and the many, many, many websites that offered advice, tibits and a variety of coding exmaples-- StackOverflow and GeekdforGeeks mainly),

    Co-Pilot, ChatGPT and Xpert for identifying debugging and slightly tweaking (not sure how to succesfully cite debugged code tho) as well as breaking down code, explaining it and over several examples.

    And Vs Code!
    
      ... we don't talk about gitbash.
